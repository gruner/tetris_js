Tetris Clone in TypeScript
==========================

## This is my Tetris clone. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

[Demo](https://gruner.io/projects/tetris/)

It's written in TypeScript and rendered using the HTML Canvas element. I wanted to create this from scratch as a learning exercise. I've avoided looking at any other clones, so it probably contains many naive and poorly implemented features of [official Tetris gameplay](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Interface).
