Tetris Clone in JavaScript
==========================

## This is my Tetris clone. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

It is written in JavaScript and rendered using the HTML Canvas element. I wanted to create this from scratch as a learning exercise, and have intentionally avoided looking at any other clones. As such, it probably contains a multitude of naive and poorly implemented features of official Tetris gameplay.

It is an ongoing project, still in its infancy.
